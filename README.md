# AR_Image_tracking

Game made with the help Of Unity Engine and C# language.

Augmented reality (AR) is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time. Unlike virtual reality (VR), which creates a totally artificial environment, AR users experience a real-world environment with generated perceptual information overlaid on top of it.

Although it is an AR Based App it can be called a game due to the movement that a user canb get.
You can always add mopre functions since the animations and cotrols were pretty much given in the assets downloaded.

It also uses the concept of Image recognition so the object(for reference here i used a dragon but you can use anything) to spawn will be spawned after seeing a particular image otherwise the augmented reality will be blank.

There is a simple controller added to the object so that the user can move it around on their screen.
